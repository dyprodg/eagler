# Postgres Next.js Next-Auth Credentials Provider Login and Registration
# Project Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Node.js and npm

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd phoshare
```

## Step 2: Start the Docker Services

Start the PostgreSQL database and other services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Make sure to check the `docker-compose.yml` file for the database username, password, and database name. Adjust these values as needed.

## Step 3: Create Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/databasename"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET='your-secret-key-generated-with-openssl-or-other-method'
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Replace `user`, `password`, `databasename`, and `your-secret-key-generated-with-openssl-or-other-method` with your actual values.

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 5: Run Prisma Migrations

Run Prisma migrations to create the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

## Step 6: Generate Prisma Client

Generate Prisma client code:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## Step 7: Open Prisma Studio

Open Prisma Studio to manage your database:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## Step 8: Start the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage
